# Expression-Recognition-in-Portrait-Images
The purpose of the project was to develop an application that can detect and identify the facial expressions of the user. At first, the face is identified and a series of key points are detected, according to the FACS model. The machine learning model is trained using a support-vector machine, with the key points as the main features. A data based with the necessary descriptions is built and used for training and testing. The application is built around a graphical user interface. The interface is optimized to predict the facial expression in real time.
